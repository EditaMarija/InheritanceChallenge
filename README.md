# CHALLENGE

* add a deriving Class "VideoPost" with a property VideoURL, Length. 
* create the required constructors to create a VideoPost
* adjust the ToString() method accordingly
* create an instance of VideoPost and use the ToString method on it.

### More advanced - use Timer and a Callback method here (google it :))
* create fields as required
* add member methods "Play" which should write the current duration of the video
* and "Stop" which should stop the "timer" and write "stopped at {0}s" onto the console.
* Play the video after creating the instance and stop it, when the user presses any key
